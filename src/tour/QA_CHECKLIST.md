# Tour QA Checklist
1. Home tour starts only when the featured example post is present.
2. Coach marks block background interaction; tooltip controls remain clickable.
3. Targets inside scroll areas auto-scroll into view and position correctly.
4. Tour skips missing targets and completes gracefully.
5. Map demo tour does not break map gestures or pins.
6. Mobile safe-area inset keeps tooltip and spotlight visible.
